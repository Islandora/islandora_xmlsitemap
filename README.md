# Islandora XML sitemap

## Description
Add urls for Islandora objects to the xmlsitemaps modules database as custom links.  When the xmlsitemap module creates it's site maps it will include these custom links.

### Notes

* Currently developed for a simple Drupal 6 site with less then 20,000 objects in Fedora.  
* We hope to do a Drupal 7 port with more configuration, we may also have to make changes to how we query for Fedora objects to handle larger Fedora collections.

### Requirements

* Drupal 6
* xmlsitemap_custom
* Islandora for drupal 6
